    <h2>What are Viruses?</h2>
    <p>A computer virus is a harmful program created to spread across computers. It can infect files, software, and the operating system. Once activated, the virus replicates itself, potentially corrupting the system, causing malfunctions, or stealing private information. Its primary goal is to spread and cause damage, often without the user's knowledge or consent.</p>
    <p>Most viruses require user interaction, such as downloading an infected file or clicking on a malicious link. Once activated, a virus may corrupt files, slow down performance, or cause system crashes.</p>
    
    <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
    <p>Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to a wide range of harmful programs, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. It encompasses any software created to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. Malware poses significant security risks by compromising systems, stealing data, or causing other forms of harm without user consent.</p>
    <p>While viruses need a host program to run, malware can be self-contained. Some types of malware, like ransomware, lock users out of their files and demand payment for restoration.</p>

    <h2>What is Spam?</h2>
    <p>Spam refers to unwanted or unsolicited messages, typically sent in bulk via email. Spam emails are often used to promote products or services, but they can also be used to spread malicious links, trick recipients into providing personal information, or infect computers with malware.</p>
    <p>Spam can be frustrating, and in some cases, it can lead to serious security risks. Users should be cautious when receiving unsolicited messages, especially if they contain suspicious attachments or links.</p>

    <h2>Why Do You Need Antivirus Software?</h2>
    <p>Antivirus software is designed to detect, block, and remove viruses and are the best protection.</li>
<li><strong>Be cautious with email:</strong> Avoid opening attachments or clicking on links from unknown senders.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your operating system and software updated:</strong> Regular updates often contain security patches that fix vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Use strong passwords:</strong> Secure your accounts with complex passwords and enable two-factor authentication when possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Back up your data:</strong> Regular backups ensure you can recover your information if your system is compromised.</li>
    </ul>
