  What is Plagiarism?
</header>

    <p>Plagiarism involves using someone else's ideas and presenting them as your own. It violates copyright laws, ethics, and academic integrity. While not a criminal offense, plagiarism is considered misconduct and can lead to expulsion from educational or work institutions. In some cases, it may result in significant fines, which can range from $2,500 to $250,000 in countries like the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.</p>

  <h1>Meaning of plagiarism in the USA<h1>
</header>

<p>
In the United States, students start
learning about plagiarism and proper
citation as early as elementary school.
University students are expected to includecitations
citations and references in their work without omission. U.S. institutions regularly provide materials on plagiarism to emphasize the importance of crediting original authors. However, international students may struggle with these policies, leading to unintentional plagiarism, which can result in disciplinary actions, including suspension or expulsion.

<h1>CONCLUSION<h1>
</header>

<p>
Plagiarism, a violation of copyright, professional ethics, and academic integrity, faces drastically different consequences globally.  Some nations punish plagiarism with hefty fines and imprisonment, while others dismiss it. The music industry witnesses frequent lawsuits, with infringing songs expunged and artists facing legal battles. Journalists, conversely, safeguard their credibility and their employer's reputation by shunning plagiarism, thus preserving their hard-earned respect.The impact of plagiarism ranges from negligible to devastating.
